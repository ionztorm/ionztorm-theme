### Feedback & Support:
This is my first theme, so I value your feedback! If you encounter any issues or have suggestions for improvement, please open an issue on our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/ionztorm/ionztorm-theme).

### Contributions:
The theme was built while using React TSX, JSON, Tailwind and HTML, so token colours should work nicely when writing these languages.

If you use different languages and notice missing syntax highlighting, please feel free to submit PR's to implement highlighting.
